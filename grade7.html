        <p id="intep">An integer (pronounced IN-tuh-jer) is a whole number (not a fractional number) that can be<br>
             positive, negative, or zero. Examples of integers are: -5, 1, 5, 8, 97, and 3,043. Examples of numbers<br>
              that are not integers are: -1.43, 1 3/4, 3.14, . 09, and 5,643.1.</p>

        <p id="intep">To add integers having the same sign, keep the same sign and add the absolute value of each number.<br>
             To add integers with different signs, keep the sign of the number with the largest absolute value and subtract <br>
             the smallest absolute value from the largest. Subtract an integer by adding its opposite.</p>

            When you multiply two integers with different signs, the result is always negative. Just multiply the absolute<br>
            values and make the answer negative. When you divide two integers with the same sign, the result is always positive. <br>
            Just divide the absolute values and make the answer positive.

            A fraction is a number that isn't a whole. For instance, 1/4 or 0.25. In the fraction, the number on top is the numerator,<br>
             and the one on the bottom is the denominator. In 1/4, the 1 is the numerator and the 4 is the denominator. Fractions are<br>
             used for many things, like telling you what portion of a whole you need, have, or want. To give you an idea how that works, <br>
